  over the interval [200, 300] using the Midpoint Rule. The Midpoint Rule is a numerical integration method that provides an approximation of the area under a curve by dividing the given interval into smaller subintervals and evaluating the function at the midpoint of each subinterval. The Python implementation in this project demonstrates how this method can be used to estimate definite integrals efficiently
